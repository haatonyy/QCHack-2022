## Description
Our work includes generating and measuring the quantum teleportation circuit, using Amazon Braket supported by qBraid cloud. We use Rigetti Aspen M-1 for our measurement. We also transpile our circuits in to Qiskit language and measure them on Qiskit.Aer Qasm Simulators and IBMQ's real backends such as ibmq_lima, ibmq_belem and ibmq_quito. Last but not least, we extend our project to "multiple-receivers" teleportation circuits and estimating The Error of measurement of teleportation circuits on IBMQ's backends. Please read the notebook for more information. <br>

This is the submission of our team for the Quantum Teleportation Challenge

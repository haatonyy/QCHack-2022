## Description
Our work includes generating and measuring the quantum teleportation circuit, using Amazon Braket supported by qBraid cloud. We also extend our project to "multiple-receivers" teleportation circuits and estimating The Error of measurement of teleportation circuits on IBMQ's backends. Please read the notebook for more information.
